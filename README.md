## Description
The website matches music to a mood. A visitor will be required to login to use the features. Once
logged in, a list of moods will appear on the web page which the visitor clicks on one mood. When they
click, a new web page view is presented showing the mood they picked and a song associated with that mood. 
There will be options to Like or Dislike the song. The like option will save to the vistors account, and 
the dislike option will show a new song. Then, there will be another web page view where the visitor can see 
their saved songs.
